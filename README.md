Keywords and Abstract
Abstract: Wi-Fi internet is everywhere. It's in our homes, jobs, schools, hotels, restaurants, planes, trains, and now our automobiles. We conduct a great deal of business from social media to financial affairs over these Wireless Access Points (WAPs). As such, it is important for users, system admins, and web developers alike to be vigilant and be mindful of the vulnerability of this information as it travels over the air. 
Man in the Middle attacks can harvest sensitive information from data transferred over wireless internet connections. This allows attackers to easily intercept usernames, passwords, and any other potentially sensitive data which is transmitted to and from the WAP. This talk will discuss the anatomy of a MITM attack performed with a Raspberry Pi on a victim user over a Wi-Fi internet connection. We will then discuss how users, developers and admins can deter these attacks.
